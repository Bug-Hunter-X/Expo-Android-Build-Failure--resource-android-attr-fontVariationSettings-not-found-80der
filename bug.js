This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with an error message similar to: `Execution failed for task ':app:processDebugResources'. > A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.res.AaptProcess.  > Android resource linking failed
...  > error: resource android:attr/fontVariationSettings not found.` This is often caused by using a newer version of Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) that is incompatible with the version of Expo being used. The newer AGP may include newer features or changes that are not yet fully supported by Expo's build system.  The error specifically points towards issues with font rendering and resource linking.
